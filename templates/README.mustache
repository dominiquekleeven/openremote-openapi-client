client = OpenRemoteApiClient(
    base_url="http://localhost:8080/api/master",
    keycloak_url="http://localhost:8081/auth",
    client_id="serviceuser",
    client_secret="your_secret",
    realm="master"
)

# Health check
status_api = StatusApi(client)
health = status_api.get_health_status()
print(f"System health: {health}")

# Query assets
asset_api = AssetApi(client)
assets = asset_api.query_assets(asset_query=AssetQuery(limit=10))
print(f"Found {len(assets)} assets")
